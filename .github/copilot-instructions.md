We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code.

## Prompt 1
I am designing an interactive webpage that presents Intel’s sustainability goals in a timeline format. Generate code for the website layout, including the following sections like - e.g., header and section tag. Define the h1 and p tags in the header and the intel-header-logo.svg with proper sizing, placement, and background color contrast. Add the following images to the section tag below the header tag with proper spacing: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, 4.jpg, 5.jpg, 6.jpg, 7.jpg, 8.jpg and 9.jpg, including the section h2, h3 and p tags center aligned above each img in the section tag. Ensure each div tag in the section tag with h2, h3 and p tags scroll horizontally on large screens and stack vertically on smaller screens. Use Flexbox to align the section tag and create a responsive layout.

Add spacing between each section div tag to match Intel’s aesthetic. Use comments in the code to explain each section and styling choice. Make the section tag reveal p tags only on hover for interactivity.

## Prompt 2
Resize the intel-header-logo.svg image to a smaller visually pleasing size in the header, centered above the h1 tag with proper padding.

## Prompt 3
Resize the .svg logo with css smaller and add appropriate padding for visual balance.

## Prompt 4
Add a modern style to the page and use common css selectors (ID, type, class, etc.) throughout the page.

## Prompt 5
Increase the size of .svg logo to more balanced and visually pleasing for the page. 

## Prompt 6
remove spacing between header-logo and the h1 tag.

## Prompt 7
Add a vibrant blue and teal color gradient background to the header section to enhance visual appeal and align with Intel's branding. Ensure the gradient transitions smoothly from blue to teal, creating a dynamic and engaging header area.
